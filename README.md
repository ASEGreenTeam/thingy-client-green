# Thingy Security (front-end)

Front-end for Thingy Security Service, a system to watch over your doors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the client you need Angular 6. You have to run the client only after having started the back-end.

### Installing

To start the client use the command

```
$ ng serve
```

from the repository. The client's url is [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Remarks

I followed [this guide](https://www.djamware.com/post/5b87894280aca74669894414/angular-6-httpclient-consume-restful-api-example#ch3) to connect it to the RESTful API. At the moment it is really simple and shows just all foos. Anyway, now doing a client showing the logs will be a trivial task.
